# Matter Security

Matter raises the bar on security to a new level beyond simply guaranteeing the communication pipe is secure. Now, the end device must be proven to be authentic. The Matter Node Security will likely raise over time. As threats evolve, the SHOULDs will become SHALLs. Creating Secure Identities and injecting them securely in your manufacturing process is not trivial and can be costly. Silicon Labs has the hardware, software, and services to get your secure Matter products to market quickly and cost effectively.

## Principles

The following are the guiding principles for the Matter security design:


## Security Tenants Promoted by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA)

1. Easy, secure, and flexible device commissioning
2. Validation that each device is authentic and certified
3. Up-to-date information via Distributed Compliance Ledger
4. Strong device identity so only your devices can join
5. Secured communications protecting confidentiality, etc.
6. Even group communications secured
7. Multiple administrators and controllers, maximizing choice
8. Verified access controls to prevent unauthorized actions
9. Secured, standard software updates
10. Remote monitoring of software integrity
