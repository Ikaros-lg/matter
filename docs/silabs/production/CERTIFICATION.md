## Why Certify

## Matter Certification Paths

There are two different types of products that can apply for Matter Certification:

**Matter Hardware Certification**

This group of certification is for embedded devices and end products, like a Matter Light or Matter Switch, that include both the software and hardware together. Typically, this is the main type of Matter Certification.

**Matter Software Component Certification**

This group of certification is for Matter Software Components, like App-based devices or a Matter Controller, where the Matter Software Component runs on a CSA Supported Operating Environment.

## Matter Testing Options

**Authorized Test Lab (ATL)**: This is the most common testing option where you can choose a CSA approved test house to perform Matter Certification Testing ([https://csa-iot.org/certification/testing-providers/](https://csa-iot.org/certification/testing-providers/)).

**Specification Validation Event (SVE)**: The CSA will host certification events where Matter Products can be tested. If a Matter product successfully completes the full phase testing series, then this product will be deemed eligible for certification and will not require additional testing.

## Possible Matter Certification Paths

**Certification by Testing a Single Product**: This is full testing at an ATL or SVE and is intended for newly designed products.

**Product Family Certification**: This certification is intended to certify variants of the same product. This path requires the first "parent" product to be fully tested either at an ATL/SVE, and then the other "family" products are certified without need for testing.

**Certification by similarity (CbS)**: This certification is intended for a very similar product that has already been certified by either standard or product family certification. If a Matter product qualifies for CbS, you can get your new product certified without additional testing. The CSA certification team will need to determine if this is an applicable route.

**Certification Transfer Program (CTP)**: This certification is for re-labeling a product manufacturer by another member. This requires an Associate CSA membership level and to partner with an Alliance Participant or Promoter member.
